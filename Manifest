		Language - also called Tuple, The Language, My Precious, honeybunny, ...

Where it should be useful
=========================

In Erlang
---------
move_work_from_stack_to_stack({{W,X},{Y_start,Y_end}}, From, To) ->
  F = fun() ->
    mnesia:write(#To{w=W, x=X, y_start=Y_start, y_end=Y_end}),
    mnesia:delete_object(#From{w=W, x=X, y_start=Y_start, y_end=Y_end})
  end,
  trans(F).

ERL refuses to compile this because of a “syntax error before: To”.
Usually, #name{field=Content} describes a record named name, with a field 
field containing Content. Here I clearly need to manipulate syntax. I want to 
create a function that'll allow me to write something like I tried: clean & easy


Purpose
=======

History
-------
Google Chrome's Omnibar (but then it was Opera's) allows for a handful of 
shortcuts. I liked the idea — and I like Regular Expressions, so it felt like a 
mighty Language was hidden behind this input[text]. I let my mind wonder around 
that supposedly as yet not-totaly-revealed grammar. Opera had a single line 
command-instruction yet powerful thing, and Google Search had a 
‹label›:‹argument› way of appending meaning to search queries. I was in a 
project which dived through text to find patterns I had to make as much general 
as possible in order to grasp most if not all valuable information that I seeked 
for (see my PHP Crawler project). I later had the idea of a 

I first thought of an OpenSearch-Terminal webpage furnished with Terminal-like 
arguments (basic ‹bin file› ‹space› ‹arg string› thing, where ‹bin file› is a 
shortname for the path).
I tried very hard to infer meaning from Opera's short 
commands, then liked Google Search's & Exalead's special search queries à la 
Perl's symbols (See my ASQ project). I was much into HTML/PHP 
hence began adding reserved words, then non-alphanumeric syntax (because I find 
it more graspable a syntax, as more dialects would read non-language-specific 
‘punctuation’) Then multiline programs

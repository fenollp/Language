Where it should be useful
=========================

In Erlang
---------

move_work_from_stack_to_stack({{W,X},{Y_start,Y_end}}, From, To) ->
  F = fun() ->
    mnesia:write(#To{w=W, x=X, y_start=Y_start, y_end=Y_end}),
    mnesia:delete_object(#From{w=W, x=X, y_start=Y_start, y_end=Y_end})
  end,
  trans(F).

ERL refuses to compile this because of a “syntax error before: To”.
Usually, #name{field=Content} describes a record named name, with a field field containing Content.
Here I clearly need to manipulate syntax. I want to create a function that'll allow me to write something
like I tried: clean & easy.
